# Odoo Stock Logistic Workflow

This project aims to deal with modules related to manage logistic flows. You'll find modules that:

 - Bring support for picking dispatch
 - Hold picking (adding a step in their workflow)
 - Ease the flow creation for the stock_location official module
 - Add filter to manage packing and deliveries

Please don't hesitate to suggest one of your module to this project. Also, you may want to have a look on those other projects here:

 - https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-tracking
 - https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-barcode
 - https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse
